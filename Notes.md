### Modes
1. Object Mode - Mainly used for viewing the overall model. You can scale, move, and rotate the object. You can also do some other stuff. 
2. Edit Mode - Used for editing specific parts of the model. You can add loop cuts, extrude regions and some other stuff.
3. Tab to easily switch between the two

### Navigation
- Middle mouse for rotating
- scroll wheel for zooming
- shift + middle mouse for panning (moving around)
- numpad . for quickly zooming in to a selected part
- view option for other stuff like jumping to a specific axis

### Transforming
- g for transforming, r for rotation, and s for scale mode
- during these modes, pressing x, y, and z will only edit that axis
- these modes are less useful. IMO, it's better to just click on the buttons instead since it's more accurate.
- snap button in center of second to top bar. This makes it easily to align objects when moving

### Adding objects
- add button
- you'll mostly use add mesh
- Object button, snap, and cursor to selected. This makes it so that when you add objects, it will be added at the selected area
- add operations - right after you add an object, you can make last changes to it. Once you click out, you can't access that again

### Editing using edit mode
- Extrude for creating more unique shapes
  - Region - extrudes region
  - Normals - extrudes along normals (used for multiple faces I think to extrude while sharing an angle)
- Inset faces - to create more faces on a face. Used to create quads instead of n-gons
  - Mesh/Merge/At center - after inseting some parts, merge the rest at center to create triangles
- Loop cut - creates more faces to work with. Also adding more allows modifiers to make the object hold its shape better
- transforming and scaling vertices, edges and faces is useful 

### Smoothing things out
- subdivision modifier - subdivides shape to make it smoother?
- bevel modifier - smoothes edges
- shade smooth - object mode, right-click. smooths things out

### Helpful modifiers
- Remember to apply transformation in Objects menu. The transformation if not applied might mess with the modifiers.
- Mirro modifiers - mirrors an object. The mirror will change along with its opposite
  - delete half of one object and mirror it

### Selection
- alt click - select connecting vertices
- shift click - multi select
