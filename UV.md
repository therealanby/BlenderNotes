## UV
- basically a 2D image wrapped around a 3D object
- other words: flattened version of 3d object
- mesh(3d object) -> UV(2d version of object) -> Material(object with texture)

## UV editing
- done in uv-editing tab
- apply the material first before going into the tab
- remember to enable texture in object/edit mode
- to view net of object in uv workspace(left), go to edit mode and hit a (select all) to view the entire object
- shortcuts
  - scroll to zoom
  - middle mouse to pan
  - left drag to zoom uv
- UV/pack islands - separates objects in an object
- select/select linked - selects linked faces
- UV/average island scale and UV/pack islands
- mirror modifier: you have to apply the modifier in object mode so the uv is now one uv instead of two(one and one mirrored)
- Smart UV Project: fixes really messed up uv
  - when applying this, make sure the scale is applied 
- Smart UV is goto uv generator. It's not perfect but it works for most scenarios
- Cube projection also is nice
