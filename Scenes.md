# Scene and textures??
## Scene
- camera for rendering
- light for rendering light (add plane underneath object to show shadows)
- remember to switch display settings (wireframe to easily access edges and vertices, solid to view solid, material to view textures, and render to view render)
- viewport: turn on scene lights to see how light affects the render and turn off scene world to show stuff in background

---

- shift-d to duplicate?

## Textures
- material
- use image as material
- name material so other objects can use it
- group materials together in select/select linked/material
