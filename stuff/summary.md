Remembering all the steps for the sword off the top of my head:

1. Outline simple shapes for the sword
2. Edit mode, make the shapes more detailed
3. Add textures
4. Edit UV so textures fit
5. Moved around textures
6. Add shaders
7. Added rocks
8. Added atmosphere
9. Animation
10. Particles 
11. Character
