**Overview**
- complemenatary colors(color wheel opposites)
- negative and positive space(glowing/not glowing??)
- 20% of canvas to stand out and 80% to be a contrast
- negative space/depth
- atmosphere can give a good sense of depth
- foreground is contrasted and clear while background is washed out (scene looks bigger, depth)

**Background/Space**
- shading tab
- world nodes is where to add the atmosphere
- volume metrics in the world output is the thing to use
- add/shader/emission - adds atmosphere/depth(adjust strength)
- compositing tab: add/color/gamma - adjusts grey values (bright and dark value crunching) (helps scene not feel so washed out)
