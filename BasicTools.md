## Basic Tools
**Bascially the only tools that you really need to make a good model**
*Note: this excludes texturing and shading**

1. Bevel - splits edges. Useful for creating circular shapes or making edges rounder or sharper
2. Merge - merges stuff. Useful for removing excess edges and creating faces
3. Extrude - expands or collapses faces(or edges or vertexes). Useful overall for creating more unique shapes out of a simple shape
4. Loop cut - create more faces. Useful for more precise extrusions. also useful for allowing modifiers to hold the shape better
5. Grid fill (face/grid fill) - fills in empty areas. Useful for filling areas
6. Shade smooth - smoothes out angles. Useful for making round objects
7. Subdivison Surface (modifier) - subdivides faces/makes more faces. Useful for making round shapes
8. Bevel (modifier) - basically bevel but it's a modifier. It will create a bevel where two faces meet. You can control which faces get beveled by changing the angles that the two faces must make to be beveled.
